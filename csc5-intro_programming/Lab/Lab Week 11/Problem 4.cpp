//Look up the bubble sort algorithm on
//google and write the pseudo-code for it.


 
//for loop start - bubble sorting
//loop until 'i' < vector.size() - 1

	//nested for loop start - individual bubble
	//loop until 'j' < vector.size() - 1
	
		//if (j > j+1), swap;
	
	//nested for loop end

//for loop end
