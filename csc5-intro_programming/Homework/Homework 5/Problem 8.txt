// Modify number 7 in which data for 2 cars will be input.
// Output the number of miles per gallon delivered by each car.
// Your program will also announce which car has the best fuel
// effciency. This problem does not require the user to perform
// the calculation as many times as they wish.
====================================================================

// call library iostream.
// declare function prototype for Miles/Gallon.
// declare constant variable Gallons/Liters = 0.264179.

// START
// Declare two cars variable for liters of Gasoline.
// Declare two cars variable for miles traveled

// open file "infile.txt"
// take input from a file

// declare MPG1 and MPG2 for car 1 and car2
// call function and store into MPG1 and MPG2

// output MPG's

// if MPG1 > MPG2

	// output MPG1 has better fuel efficiency

// otherwise

	// MPG2 has better fuel efficiency
