<p>First programming language I learned was C programming language, but now I use C++ as a main language.<br />
I also learned or still learning Ruby programming language.</p>

<p>My first game project was the Snake game. I used C++/SDL to create this game. <br />
I've never learn SDL before so it was confusing at first, but I got used to it after few days.<br />
Coolest thing about programming is that, second or third programming language is very easy to learn after the first one.<br />
That's why I was able to learn SDL and make this graphic game in two weeks.</p>

<p>When I'm not working on any projects, I goto Online Judge or similar website to solve programming problems.<br />
The Project Euler is one of them; I goto ACMICPC(korean) most of the time because it actually checks my code while <br />
Project Euler is just about the results.</p>

<p>Now I'm learning HTML5 and my goal is make my own website.</p>
